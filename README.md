# Lolei
Lo le√≠ translates to, 'I read it' in Spanish, and here at Lolei,
we are all about keeping children reading. Reading a 1000 books 
before Kindergarten? No Problem! Summer reading? We got you covered. 
We offer a simple and fun way for children to keep track of books 
they have read, while allowing parents or teachers to monitor their 
progress.
